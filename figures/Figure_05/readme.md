# ECB DNA analysis

**Figure_5B_sWGS_plots.R** - Script to generate scatterplots from shallow wgs results processed with qdnaseq

**Figure_5D.1_inferred_growth_trajectories_ECB_clones.R** - RG-specific "absolute fitness" estimation by growth curve analysis on a specific culture

**Figure_5D.2_inferred_growth_trajectories_ECB_clones_make_long.py** - Script to combine RGC matrix (barcode frequencies) and growth derivatives in long format for plotting

**Figure_5D.3_Growth_derivative_plot.R** - Script to plot inferred growth derivative per subclone

**Note:**

**Figure_5C** - Scripts for Mueller plots are found in the "Analysis" folder, under "ECB_DNA_pipeline"
